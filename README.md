**#Metagenomics Reveals Spatial Variation in Cyanobacterial Composition, Function, and Biosynthetic Potential in the Winam Gulf, Lake Victoria, Kenya (2022 and 2023)**

This repository hosts the code and data tables necessary for the analysis of metagenomic data collected from the Winam Gulf, Lake Victoria, Kenya in 2022 and 2023 in Hart et al. 2024. This work could not have been done without the support of the NSF IRES Funding. (https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1953468)

Please see the code folder for all R code associated with the analysis of this data. All other files in the scripts, results, references, and results files are referenced in these scripts.
